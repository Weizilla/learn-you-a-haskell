So far, we've worked with I/O by printing out stuff to the terminal and reading from it
But what about reading and writing files? Well, in a way, we've already been doing that
One way to think about reading from the terminal is to imagine that it's like reading from a (somewhat special) file
Same goes for writing to the terminal, it's kind of like writing to a file
We can call these two files stdout and stdin, meaning standard output and standard input, respectively
Keeping that in mind, we'll see that writing to and reading from files is very much like writing to the standard output and reading from the standard input
